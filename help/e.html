This option allows you to use EliteOCR in a different language than English. More languages will 
be added in the future.
<br><br>
OCR language<br>
This option allows you to choose which language should be used to recognize the text in the schreenshots.
It is crucial to choose here the right language.
<br><br>
Translate results<br>
If checked all the results will be translated to English upon exporting. Export to BPC and EDDN is
always translated.
<br><br>
Automatically add results with high confidence<br>
Check this box if you want to automatically add results with hight confidence to the table. This is 
only recommended for screenshots with height of 1080 pixel or more. Lower resolutions will result in 
many errors.
<br><br>
Remove duplicates<br>
This option removes duplicate entries in the table. Duplicates are recognized by the same station 
and commodity name. Don't use it if you scan differently old screenshots of the same station at 
the same time.
<br><br>
Pause "OCR All"<br>
The OCR process waits until the user clicks on "Continue to next file" at the end of a file. This is
recomended if using the high confidence option and deleting files option.
<br><br>
Delete processes images<br>
Processed images will be deletes after being processed. The file will be only removed if the user 
clicks on "Continue to next file".
<br><br>
<b>Paths</b><br><br>
Screenshot directory<br>
This is the directory which will open every time you click on the + to add screenshots to file list.
<br><br>
Log directory<br>
This is the directory which contains log files. It is important to properly set this location in order
to automatically obtain system names for the screenshots.
<br><br>
Export directory<br>
This location will always open when you click on "Export". Trade Dangerous Export uses this location 
to save the import.prices file.
<br><br>
<b>Misc</b><br><br>
Use native file dialog<br>
Forces EliteOCR to use Windows' native file dialog. This dialog might ignore the paths set in the settings.
<br><br>
Horizontal Export<br>
Check this box if you want your xlsx, csv or ods data to be horizontally aligned. This means the
column names of the result table will be listed in the first column under each other.
<br><br>
<b>Commodities Editor</b><br>
Commodities editor shows the list of commodities "known" to EliteOCR. The commodities editor can be 
used to add, remove or edit entries.
<br><br>
<b>Public Mode</b><br>
If the public mode is set you will be able to export to BPC and EDDN. There are limitations in this mode.
If you use screenshots with low resolution you will be forced to wait 1,5 seconds before you can add every
line you process to the result table. If you switch between the modes the result table will be cleared.
