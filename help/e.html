<h3>Settings</h3>

<p>
<b>Screenshot directory</b><br>
This is the directory which will open every time you click on the + to add screenshots to file list.
<br><br>
<b>Log directory</b><br>
This is the directory which contains log files. It is important to properly set this location in order
to automatically obtain system names for the screenshots.
<br><br>
<b>Export directory</b><br>
This location will always open when you click on "Export". Trade Dangerous Export uses this location 
to save the import.prices file.
<br><br>
<b>Horizontal Export</b><br>
Check this box if you want your xlsx, csv or ods data to be horizontally aligned. This means the
column names of the result table will be listed in the first column under each other.
<br><br>
<b>Automatically add results with high confidence</b><br>
Check this box if you want to automatically add results with hight confidence to the table. This is 
only recommended for screenshots with height of 1080 pixel or more. Lower resolutions will result in 
many errors.
<br><br>
<b>Remove duplicates</b><br>
This option removes duplicate entries in the table. Duplicates are recognized by the same station 
and commodity name. Don't use it if you scan differently old screenshots of the same station at 
the same time.
<br><br>
<b>Save images for machine learning</b><br>
This option will save every processed image in "nn_training_images" directory. EliteOCR is not learning
on the fly because it is taking too long. Instead you can provide the images to user zxctypo 
(on elite dangerous forum). He performs the learning process and improves the OCR engine.
<br><br>
<b>Commodities Editor</b><br>
Commodities editor shows the list of commodities "known" to EliteOCR. Every time a unknown commodity 
is recognized by the OCR process, it is added to this list. If the user is not careful it can 
contain misspelled entries and therefore result in frequent errors. The commodities editor can be 
used to add, remove or edit entries. Upon saving the entries are sorted alphabetically and 
duplicates are removed.
