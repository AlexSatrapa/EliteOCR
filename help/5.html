<h3>There is a delay on "Add and next"</h3>

EliteOCR is limiting users of low res screenshots by forcing them to check their data. This was
necessary as those users exported their faulty data to public services like BPC and EDDN.
<br><br>
If you don't use those services you can swich to private mode and remove those limitations by 
deselcting "Public Mode" in Settings.
<br><br>
If you use screenshots of 1920x1080 and did not change the FOV settings in the game you should not 
see this behavior. Should it still happen, please report it in the forum.
