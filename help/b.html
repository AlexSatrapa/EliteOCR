<h3>Running OCR</h3>

<p>
Once you have files added to your file list you can perform OCR on them. Only properly recognized 
files will be processed.<br><br>
You can OCR the files one by one by clicking on the button "OCR". Clicking "OCR All" will result in 
automatic OCR on the next file after one has been fully processed.
<br><br>
The progress of the OCR process is indicated by the progress bar in the bottom of the window.
