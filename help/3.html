<h3>Numbers missing in OCR results</h3>

It can happen that EliteOCR misses some numbers while reading the screenshot.
<br>
This happens actually only if you use screenshots smaller than 1680 by 1050px. It is not recommended
to use EliteOCR with such screenshots. Additionally you will be forced to wait 1,2 seconds on every line you process.

Should you have the problem even if you use screenshots of 1050 or higher:
<br><br>
- If you changed the field of view setting in the game files the resulting resolution might be
significantly lower. I recommend using the standard FOV settings in the game.
<br><br>
- If you changed brightness, contrast or gamma settings in the game please run color calibration from settings menu.
<br><br>
- If you changed the interface color in the game please run color calibration from settings menu.
