<h3>Numbers missing in OCR results</h3>

It can happen that EliteOCR misses some numbers while reading the screenshot.
<br>
This happens actually only if you use screenshots smaller than 1920 by 1080px. It is not recommended
to use EliteOCR with such screenshots. Additionally the export function to BPC and EDDN is disabled
in this case. You still would be able to export to xlsx, csv and ods.

Should you have the problem even if you use screenshots of 1080 or higher:
<br><br>
- If you changed the field of view setting in the game files the resulting resolution might be
significantly lower. I recommend using the standard FOV settings in the game.
<br><br>
- If you changed brightness, contrast or gamma settings in the game please reset those to standard.
EliteOCR is sensitive to color changes in screenshots.
<br><br>
- If you changed the interface color in the game files please revert it to standard(orange).
