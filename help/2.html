<h3>Screenshot not recognized</h3>

EliteOCR tries to recognize valid market screenshots by finding long horizontal lines and using them
to calibrate the OCR area. This may fail if you changed display settings like brightness or gamma in game.
<br><br>
EliteOCR does not support (yet) custom interface colors. (please provide me the screenshots so I can work on this)
<br><br>
Should you have problems even if you didn't change anything in the game please provide the screenshot to
seeebek on the forums.
